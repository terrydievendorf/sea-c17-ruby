# Copy the previous OrangeTree class and extend it with the following method:
#
#   OrangeTree#pick(amount = 1) → OrangeTree
#
#     Returns itself if @fruit is less than the amount to pick.
#     Otherwise, returns a new OrangeTree object with it's fruit instance
#     variable initialized to the difference between @fruit and amount.
#     The default amount is 1.
#
#     orange_tree = OrangeTree.new
#     orange_tree.fruit     #=> 50
#     orange_tree.pick      #=> OrangeTree.new(49)
#     orange_tree.pick(49)  #=> OrangeTree.new(1)
#     orange_tree.pick(50)  #=> OrangeTree.new(0)
#     orange_tree.pick(51)  #=> orange_tree
#     orange_tree.fruit     #=> 50
#
# Hint: To successfully complete this exercise, an OrangeTree object's @fruit
# instance variable should be assigned once and only once.
#
# Where should it be assigned? From within the initialize method. Once assigned,
# the @fruit instance variable should never, ever change.
#
# If you feel compelled to reassign @fruit outside the initialize method, you
# should stop and rethink your approach.

class OrangeTree
  # your code here
  def initialize(fruit = 50)
    @fruit = fruit
  end

  def fruit() Integer
    @fruit
  end

  def pick! (amount = 1)
    return if amount > fruit
    initialize(fruit - amount)
  end

  def pick (amount = 1) OrangeTree
    return self if amount > fruit
    OrangeTree.new(fruit - amount)

    return false
