# Write a program that prints out the lyrics to that beloved classic,
# "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall." Here's what the output should look like:
#
# 99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall!
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall!
# ...
# 2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, 1 bottle of beer on the wall!
# 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer!
# Take one down, pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall!
