# Write a program that asks for a starting year and an ending year and then puts
# all the leap years between them (and including them, if they are also leap
# years). Leap years are years divisible by 4 (like 1984 and 2004). However,
# years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they
# are also divisible by 400 (such as 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap
# years). What a mess!

puts 'Indicate a starting year'
starting_year = gets.chomp.to_i

puts 'Indicate an ending year'
ending_year = gets.chomp.to_i

index_year = starting_year

while index_year <= ending_year
  if index_year % 4 == 0 && index_year % 100 != 0 || index_year % 400 == 0
    puts "Leap year: #{index_year}"
  end

  index_year += 1
